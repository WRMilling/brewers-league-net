# What is this place?

This is a site for the D&D league that is at Shezmu Cellars. We meet every Thursday at 6:00 - 8:00 pm to play Dungeons & Dragons. 

# How do I join?

You can always just come and join us and bring a group of your own or join one of ours if there is room. You can keep up to date with us by signing up for notifications. This is also where individual signup forms will be: [Brewer's League](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUbxminETubo_GZS2kfVHjhiOKT_ieTox0wjoDiPAozVkCNA/viewform "Brewer's League Notification Signup Form")

# Can I play my own things?

Yes! We welcome pretty much any type of games - even if you want to just come and play the board games at the Cellars.
